 enter into database:  \c nba_db
 shows all players: SELECT * FROM players;

1. SELECT * FROM players WHERE team = 'NYK';
2. SELECT * FROM players WHERE team = 'IND'AND age < 26;
3. SELECT * FROM players ORDER BY points ASC;
4. SELECT name, points FROM players ORDER BY points DESC limit 20;
5. SELECT AVG(age) FROM players;
6.  SELECT AVG(age) FROM players WHERE team = 'OKC';
7.  SELECT AVG(age) FROM players WHERE games > 40;

I know how to get the some of points for a particular team:
8. SELECT SUM(points) FROM players WHERE team = 'NYK';

--but how do you get sum of points from each team AND show them is DESC order?
